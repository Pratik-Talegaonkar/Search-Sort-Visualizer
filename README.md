# Flow - Algorithm Visualizer 🌊

**Flow** is a modern, interactive web application designed to visualize how common sorting and searching algorithms work. Built with a focus on aesthetics and user experience, it transforms complex algorithmic concepts into beautiful, fluid animations.

## ✨ Features

-   **Algorithmic Suite**: Visualize 5 sorting algorithms and 2 searching algorithms.
-   **Modern UI/UX**: A sleek, dark-themed interface with glassmorphism effects and smooth transitions.
-   **Interactive Controls**: Real-time control over array size and sorting speed.
-   **Educational Documentation**: Integrated documentation explaining the logic, time complexity, and space complexity of each algorithm.
-   **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across different screen sizes.

## 🚀 Live Demo

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **HTML5**: Structure and semantics.
-   **CSS3**: Custom properties (variables), Flexbox, Grid, and Animations.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core logic, DOM manipulation, and `async/await` for visualization control.

## 🧮 Implemented Algorithms

### Sorting
1.  **Bubble Sort**: The classic stepping stone. Simple but effective for learning.
2.  **Selection Sort**: Visualizes how the minimum element is selected and placed.
3.  **Insertion Sort**: Shows how an array is built one item at a time.
4.  **Quick Sort**: Demonstrates the power of Divide and Conquer with partitioning.
5.  **Merge Sort**: visualization of splitting and merging arrays.

### Searching
1.  **Linear Search**: A simple sequential search.
2.  **Binary Search**: An optimized search for sorted arrays (includes auto-sorting visualization!).
